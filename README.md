 * Working with "Marks"
 * Field formatting
 * Filters, Actions and using "Context"
 * Cumulative totals
 * Dashboard creation

### Dashboard overview
The dashboard addresses key questions about the HR data:
* How many people are in each job?
* What is the gender distribution across roles?
* What is the age spread of our staff?
* Which jobs pay more?
* Who are the top 3 earners by job title?
* How does qualification influence salary?
* What is the staff growth trend look like?
* How can we filter employees by the starting letter of their names?

### Findings
Based on the HR data analyzed and visualized in the dashboard:
* Department Distribution: The majority of employees work in packaging and production departments.
* Gender Composition: There are more women employees than men.
* Age Analysis: The majority of the staff are aged 30 to 40 years old.
* Staff Growth: Over the years, the number of women employees has increased and now surpasses men.
* Salary vs. Qualification: Employees with a Master's degree earn the most.
* Highest Paid Job: The Product Manager role is the highest-paying job title.
* Leave balance: Male employees generally have higher leave balances than females.

### Recommendations
* With the majority of staff aged 30â€“40 years, offer benefits that cater to this age group, such as family healthcare plans, childcare support, and professional development opportunities.
* Since higher qualifications are linked to better pay, offer subsidies or internal programs to help employees gain advanced degrees or certifications.
* Although there are more women employees than men overall, review the representation of women in leadership or higher-paying roles (e.g., Product Managers). Introduce mentoring programs and leadership development initiatives to empower women for higher-level positions.
* Investigate gender disparities in leave usage to ensure policies are equitable and accessible for both male and female employees.
